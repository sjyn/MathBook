\chapter{Rings}

Our study of groups only scratched the surface of the vast array of algebraic structures.
Here, we will examine another algebraic structure that is more complex than groups.
Rings are an example of a structure with two operations, and as such require fine attention to detail in order to guarantee that the structure makes sense.
