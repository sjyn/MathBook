\chapter{Graph Theory and Combinatorics}

Graph theory is concerned with the study of structures we call graphs as well as topics within combinatorics.
By \textit{graph}, we don't mean graphs in the $f(x)$ sense; rather, we are talking about nodes connected by edges.
Often times, we represent these graphs with a picture involving dots and lines, representative of vertices and edges, respectively.
Throughout our discussion, keep in mind that we cannot rely on a picture for a proof, but it is very helpful to see the pictures to get an understanding of what's happening.
