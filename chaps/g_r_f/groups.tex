\chapter{Groups}

This chapter focuses on a very important structure known as a group. We will look at groups in great detail; an in depth study of rings and fields are slightly beyond the scope of this book, and as such are covered together in the following chapter. These three structures unite many of the ideas in Number Theory, Analysis, Differential Equations, and many more fields of study in mathematics.
