\section{Homomorphisms}

At the end of our discussion of factor groups, we pointed out that there are some groups that look like and act like other groups.
In this section, we will discuss in detail this phenomenon through the study of what are known as homomorphisms.
Like many of the concepts covered in the study of groups, we have seen homomorphisms before but never called them by name; consider the following definition.

\begin{definition}{Homomorphism}
    Let $(G_{1},*_{1})$ and $(G_{2},*_{2})$ be groups. A homomorphism from $G_{1}$ to $G_{2}$ is a mapping
    \[
        \phi: G_{1}\to G_{2}\suchthat \phi(a*_{1}b)=\phi(a)*_{2}\phi(b).
    \]
\end{definition}
This function that we call a homomorphism is just a structure preserving map.
In the case of groups, we preserve the operations in the respective groups as well as inverses and identities.
We have dealt with several homomorphisms in previous sections; consider the following examples.

\begin{example}{Show $\det$ is a homomorphism from $GL_{n}(\RR)\to\RR$.}
    Let $A,B\in GL_{n}(\RR)$. Then $\det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B)\in\RR$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{Show $sgn$ is a homomorphism from $Sym_{n}\to\{\pm1\}$.}
    We will show that the homomorphic nature of $sgn$ holds for one of the possible combinations of two permutations here.
    Suppose $\sigma,\tau\in Sym_{n}$ with $sgn(\sigma)=1$ and $sgn(\tau)=1$. Then
    \[
        sgn(\sigma\tau)=1=1\cdot 1=sgn(\sigma)sgn(\tau).
    \]
    The other combinations of even and odd are left to you.
\end{example}

It is important to note that the definition of homomorphism does \textbf{not} require that $\phi$ be invertible, but when $\phi^{-1}$ is defined on $G_{2}$, we get some very special properties.

\subsection*{Isomorphisms}
The ability to invert functions is not something that we can often do; we have a special name for an invertible homomorphism.
\begin{definition}{Isomorphism}
    Let $\phi$ be a homomorphism from $G_{1}\to G_{2}$. We call $\phi$ an isomorphism if $\phi$ is bijective on $G_{1}$.
\end{definition}
