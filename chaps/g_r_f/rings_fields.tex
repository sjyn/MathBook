\chapter{Rings and Fields}

Our study of groups only scratched the surface of the vast array of algebraic structures.
Here, we will examine two more algebraic structures that are more complex than groups.
Rings and fields are examples of structures with two operations, and as such require fine attention to detail in order to guarantee that the definitions hold.
We will begin with the simpler of the two structures, and a personal favorite of mine, rings.
