\chapter{Definitions}

This appendix includes many of the definitions found throughout the book. We cannot begin to understand the theorems and results of mathematics without first having a definition on which to stand. Unfortunately, some of the most fundamental ideas in mathematics don't actually have definitions (can we define what a \textit{number} is?); as such, use this section with caution, as it will not contain every definition in the world of mathematics. We should also note that some definitions are dependent on varying circumstances (i.e. \textit{Cauchy} in $\QQ_{p}$ versus \textit{Cauchy} in $\RR$). If you want to see an application of the definition, refer back to the chapter from which it comes.
