\chapter{Major Theorems}

This appendix states the major theorems of the book (i.e. anything with the word \textit{Fundamental} in the name). It is useful as a quick reference guide, but not meant to be a comprehensive review. Often times, we can take more from the proof of a theorem than the theorem itself, so if a theorem does not make sense, try to review the section from which it came.

\begin{namedtheorem}[Theorem of Lagrange]
    Let $G$ be a group with $ord(G) < +\infty$ and let $H \leq G$. Then $ord(H)|ord(G)$.
